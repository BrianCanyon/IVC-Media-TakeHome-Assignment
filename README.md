README

This project is meant to capture a take home assignment from IVC media following an interview on Jan 29.
My understanding of the requirements are bulleted below:
    1) Create a categorization algorithm for text based data
        - NLTK
        - sklearn
    2) Create an ETL pipeline that includes event triggers
        - Airflow (DAG)
        - Flask
    3) Define a data warehouseing solution (ie. SQL, noSQL, Graph, ect.)
        - pSQL
    4) Create an open endpoint API
        - Flask
        - psycopg2


Each of the four bullets will have an associated file that is specfically addressed to tackle those 
requiremnets. 1,2, & 4 (see Oxford comma as discussed in interview) will be a commented .py script. 3
will be a text file discussing the pros and cons of various warehousing solutions. 

The solutions to these problems will highlight the stregnths of python toolkits and (open source) frameworks I am most familiar with. A quick overview of the libraries used will be included within code comments. While tool and
frame- work decisions are certainly baised towards what I am have most experierince in, they also represent 
widely used tools in the AI/ML/DS industry.
